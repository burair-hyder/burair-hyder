## Hey there! 👋  

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!  

I’m *Burair Hyder*, a first-year **BSCS** student at *FAST Karachi,a proud A-Level survivor (got all A`*`s 😉), <br>
and a full-time coder (well, part-time procrastinator too).<br>
Armed with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **C**, I’m on a mission to make the digital world a little cooler, one bug fix at a time.  

---

## 🚀 *What I Do*  
- *Debugging*: `First things first`- I waste hours looking for missing semicolons.<br> (Yes, they’re always in the last place I check.)  
- *Web Development*: I create web pages so sleek, they might just slide off your screen.  
- *Game Development*: Made a **car collision game in C**—don’t worry, it’s way less destructive than it sounds.  
- *Virtual Classroom Wizardry*: Co-built a **Google Classroom clone**, <br> proving that great minds don’t *just think alike—they also code alike.  

---

## 📚 *Currently Exploring*  
- *Data Structures & Algorithms*: Because sorting things alphabetically isn’t as easy as it looks.  
- *Advanced Frameworks*: Diving into the tools that make developers’ lives easier (and lazier).  
- *Life*: **`Still figuring out why my coffee gets cold while I debug code.`**

## 🤝 *Let’s Be Friends!*  
Got a fun project? Let’s collab! Got a bad joke? I’m here for it too. <Br>Hit me up—let’s turn ideas into reality (or at least compile them without errors).
